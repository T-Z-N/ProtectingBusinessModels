## Overview

Business models are critical but vulnerable assets in today's innovation-driven economy. While practitioners employ diverse defensive tactics and scholars have produced valuable research on specific protection strategies, this knowledge remains fragmented. Our research addresses this gap by developing the first comprehensive taxonomy of business model protection mechanisms.

## Key Contributions

- **15 Top-Level Protection Strategies**: A validated framework identifying the core strategies for business model protection
- **Hierarchical Taxonomy**: A multi-level structure showing how 176 initial mechanisms relate through composition, abstraction, and means-end relationships
- **Interactive Visualization Tools**: Custom D3.js tools for exploring the taxonomy and understanding mechanism relationships
- **Replicable Methodology**: A novel approach combining expert workshops, computational text analysis, and structured validation

## Using the Tools

### Clique Analysis Tool
```bash
# Open the interactive clique tool
open clique_tool.html

# Adjust the similarity threshold using the slider
# Observe clique formation at different threshold levels
# Use for identifying semantic clusters in your own data
```

### Taxonomy Browser
```bash
# Explore the final validated taxonomy
open taxonomy_visualization.html

# Navigate through the hierarchical structure
# Click on nodes to explore relationships
# Use legend to understand relationship types
```

## Theoretical Framework

Our taxonomy reveals business model protection as a **dynamic system of interconnected actions** rather than a static portfolio of assets. The prevalence of Means-End relationships throughout the taxonomy demonstrates that protection mechanisms should be understood by what they do, not just what they are.

### Relationship Types

- **Composition/Aggregation (C/A)**: Child represents a part of the parent
- **Abstraction/Specification (A/S)**: Child is a type or instance of the parent category  
- **Means/End (M/E)**: Child serves as a method for achieving the parent objective

## Practical Applications

### For Managers
- **Strategic Diagnosis**: Map current protection activities onto the framework
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify overlooked protection mechanisms
- **Portfolio Planning**: Understand how different strategies reinforce each other

### For Researchers
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Structured vocabulary for business model protection research
- **Comparative Studies**: Framework for analyzing protection strategies across contexts
- **Future Research**: Starting point for deeper investigation of specific mechanisms

## Limitations and Future Work

- **Context**: Based on European manufacturing-focused workshop
- **Generalizability**: Requires validation across diverse industries and cultures
- **Granularity**: Future work could explore more detailed relationship classifications
- **Practitioner Validation**: Additional validation with industry practitioners needed
